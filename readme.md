# Visualization of sorting algorithms

This side project focused on visualizing most common sorting algorithms.

**_here will be project updated during development_**

## **Bubble sort visualization**

Bubble sort - is the most basic sorting algorithms and it probably familiar to every person that does programing.

Currently in this implementation is used classic bubble sort algorithm without any additional optimizations.

It is called "Bubble sort" because biggest elements of array float up like bubbles.

**Time complexity:** O(n<sup>2</sup>)

**Space complexity:** O(1)

**Visual representation:**
